# Cinema Release Watcher

## Description

Cinema release watcher is a script designed to be run on a weekly basis to be updated of new movies coming out.
I personally make it run in a GitHub action every week.

In order to send the weekly document to users, this project uses a Telegram bot.
This project can be forked in order to update the configuration file.

## How to use
